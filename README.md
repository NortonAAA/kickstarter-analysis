### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges to this data set included inital review of outliers and filtered to understand impact on other areas where requested Goal was abnormally high and could skew results of the data. This was filtered out of this analysis by focusing on the category needed.
## Results

- The most successful campaigns for a play were launched in the month of May.
- The least succesful campaigns for a play were launched in the month of December. 

- The most successful campaigns have a goal between $35,000 and $45,000.
- There are also opportunities for smaller campaigns to be successful if less than $5,000.

- This dataset includes all International locations and any focus on US market would need to be filtered accordingly.

- Another potential comparison would be review of Percentage Funded above the Goal.
